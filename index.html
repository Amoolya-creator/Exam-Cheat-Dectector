            This Program is designed to catch cheats in examination hall with MCQ-type of papers.
        </h5>
        <p class="m-3 p-3 border border-danger bg-light text-justify">
            The program displays sets of Roll Numbers of students who have high incidence of similar answers.
        </p>
        <p class="m-3 p-3  border border-danger  bg-light text-justify">Since brilliant students would score highly and their answers would be matching
            too, hence this program also picks those students. The decision whether a set of students is a brilliant
            cohort or a cheat group, can be deduced by the percentage of correct replies from them. A high cut-off of
            90% should be sufficient to separate the two groups. However this factor is arbitrary and can be modified to
            suit individual needs.
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bolder">
                One can adjust the Cut-off Factor in the program.
            </span>
        </p>
        <h6 class="m-3 p-3 border border-danger bg-light text-justify">This program is a good tool for Administration / Universities / Councils / Boards
            to implement and minimise cheating practices.
            They can state in Terms & Conditions of their examinations that groups of students who shall be flagged by
            this program may have to appear in a separate "distinctive" examination to prove their calibre. This step
            shall identify any cheats.
